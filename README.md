blocker
=============

for when a RT was an endorsement, block everybody who RT'd a tweet


## Usage

```npm install -g blocker```

Create a twitter application and generate an access key.

Stick your API + access keys in config.json

run

```blocker --url="<tweet-url>""```

or

```blocker <tweet-id>```

(warning, will only block the first for the moment)
